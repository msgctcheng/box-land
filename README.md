# Box Land - CSS Float Practice
                        HTML5 | CSS3

**Box Land** is a practice exercise I created for myself when I was learning about Floats in CSS.

* Essentially it is several parent `<div>` tags with several child `<div>` tags; numbered based on how many other boxes are contained within the parent `<div>`.

* My goal was to practice using `float, width, padding` and other style attributes to evenly space the child `<div>` tags within each parent `div`.

* I also made the design responsive; having it shrink with the screen size.
