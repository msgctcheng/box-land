# Box Land - CSS Float Practice


**Box Land** is a practice exercise I created for myself when I was learning about Floats in CSS.

* Essentially it is several parent `<div>` tags with several child `<div>` tags; numbered based on how many other boxes are contained within the parent `<div>`.

* My goal was to practice using Floats and other CSS to create evenly spaced boxes within each parent box.
